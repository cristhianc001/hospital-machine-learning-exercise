# Two Cases of Supervised Learning: Predicting car prices and hospitalization with linear regression and classification models

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of cars based on various attributes. It also includes a classification model to predict whether a car is expensive or cheap. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This folder contains saved trained models.
- `scripts/`: This folder contains utility scripts used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- `visualization/`: This folder contains visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of car attributes such as wheelbase, car length, car width, engine size, horsepower, and more. The target variable is the price of the car.

## Usage

To reproduce the results and run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd car-price-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to perform exploratory data analysis, train the prediction and classification models, and evaluate their performance.
